### Logo

by DALL·E

```prompt
Create a simplified website icon focusing on the concepts of 'Web URL', 'academic research', and 'conversion arrow' (optional). The icon should feature a simplified representation of a globe or chain link to symbolize the web, an open book or microscope to represent academic research, and a conversion arrow to indicate the process of transforming URLs. The design should be minimalistic, using clear lines and limited colors to ensure it's easily recognizable and conveys the essence of accessing and converting academic resources online.
```
